<h1>Titrator firmware</h1>
<p>
  This repository conssits of many pieces of C++ code. The code is written as firmware for Arduino as the main part in my highschool term paper.
  I constructed automatic titrator for performing acid-base titration automatically.
</p>
<p>
  For operation, the control software is needed: <a href="https://github.com/melimat/Titrator_control_software">https://github.com/melimat/Titrator_control_software</a>
</p>
<p>
  The final version of firmware (April 2019) is "Titrator_pure_state_machine.ino" on "Pure_state_machine branch"
